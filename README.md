# phpBB by przemo oop

Just having fun refactoring very old php4 based script that no one wants to touch. 
Perhaps someone will be inspired and will continue the work that I have started, because this will not be finished on my side.

The goals i have on my mind is to:

1. Refactor everything to be more OOP than it is right now ;)
2. Replace old template engine with Twig and it's syntax (who uses that quasi HTML today?)
3. Go towards Symfony framework
4. Make new cool stuff
